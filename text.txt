Dear International Graduate Students at Ontario Tech University:

 

As you are aware, the university has moved all courses online in response to the COVID-19 situation. Access to campus services could be restricted as social distancing and other safety measures are implemented to ensure the well-being of our community. Please note that SGPS is closed until further notice, but SGPS personnel will be available remotely to assist you.

 

You are valued members of the Ontario Tech University community. During these times of uncertainty, I recognize that the pandemic may intensify levels of stress for international students and postdoctoral fellows who are away from friends and family. I want to reassure you that our SGPS team and other university units will continue to provide as much support as possible to ensure your safety and that your studies proceed as smoothly as possible.
