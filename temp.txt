With just one phone call, an appointment was scheduled for the very next morning. I was very impressed with the level of care. I was put on a waiting list for an MRI. The next day I met with the La Vie team. I was put on a waiting list for an MRI. The next day I met with the La Vie team. I had something, but it wasn’t conclusive. A few months later, I had more symptoms. The La Vie team sent me for another MRI the next day. They found another neurosurgeon and I met him that day. The diagnosis: brain cancer stage 4 (glioblastoma). He told me that I needed surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for one year. If I would not comply, I would have 3 months to live. So, I can claim that the La Vie team saved my life. The team included the neurosurgeon, oncologist and radiologist to whom I am also extremely grateful. My family and I strongly recommend La Vie team. I'm beyond words. I cannot thank you guys enough. https://youtu.be/QaoaXWuyw8k Maureen Graham Owner and manager at Tony Graham Nissan La Vie Executive Health Centre 5  2018-06-12T22:01:25-05:00 Maureen Graham Owner and manager at Tony Graham Nissan The extra care, the
